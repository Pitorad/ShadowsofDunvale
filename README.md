# ShadowsofDunvale
Shadows of Dunvale is a horror-mystery about a struggling true-crime writer trapped in a fog-shrouded village where a missing woman, a buried cult, and something older than memory linger in the trees. Your choices shape Elias’s mind, his journal, and one of many fates waiting in the dark.
